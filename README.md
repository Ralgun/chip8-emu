# chip8-emu
A simple chip8 emulator I created as C++ practice. Needs SDL2 for it to work.<br>
The worst makefile also included!<br>
<br>
# Usage
Simply drag and drop a file you want to open or open cmd and write: <br>'**chip8emu.exe path/to/the/game.ch8**'<br>
You can also specify the number of operation per second at the end of the command!
